# Better ScoreBoard

Scoreboard HUD pinned to the right, powered by MultipleHUD. You can edit it live in-game with `/scoreboard` or through `BetterScoreBoard/config.yaml`.

## Features
- Custom title, logo, refresh rate, and line count
- In-game editor panel: add/edit/remove lines directly from `/scoreboard`
- Placeholder support: `{server}`, `{world}`, `{online}`, `{max_players}`, `{player}`, `{playtime}`, `{tps}`, `{money}`
- Ships with a default logo at `Custom/Textures/BetterScoreBoard/logo.png` (override via config)

## Configuration
The plugin writes `BetterScoreBoard/config.yaml` on first start. Edit it and reload the mod to apply changes, or use `/scoreboard` to tweak lines and click “Sauvegarder + Config” to persist.
